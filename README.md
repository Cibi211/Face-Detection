# Face Detection Using OpenCV

This project implements face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier. It processes frames from a video file, detects faces, and highlights them with a bounding box.

## Features
Uses Haar Cascade (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) for face detection.

Processes frames from a video .

Converts frames to grayscale for better detection accuracy.

Detects faces and draws rectangles around them.

Displays live face detection status ("Face Detected" / "No Face").

Press Esc to exit the program.
